# SnowProBookmarks

This is the place where you can download bookmarks and highlights compatible with Raindrop.io to help you study for your SnowPro Core Certification.

Download the zip file. It contains 3 files: 
- export.txt: contains bookmarked links
- export.html: contains both links and highlighted texts
- export.csv: contains both links and highlighted texts

Use the csv file to upload bookmarks into your Raindrop account. Once uploaded whenever you access bookmarked and highlighted webpage, highlight will show right in the browser.
